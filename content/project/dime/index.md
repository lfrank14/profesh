External motivation, such as a promise of future monetary reward for remembering an event, can affect which events are remembered. Reward-based memory modulation is thought to result from encoding and post-encoding interactions between dopaminergic midbrain, signaling reward, and hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, supporting episodic memory. In this project, we explored whether hippocampal and parahippocampal interactions with other reward-related regions are related to reward modulation of memory and whether such relationships are stable over time.

Findings from the project can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-019-00700-8).
