Memory integration refers to the process by which new experiences are linked to and stored with related memories. How memory integration affects the individual memories is unclear. Some have argued that memory integration protects against interference between related memories, while others have shown that memory integration leads to interference. One possibility is that these contradictory findings reflect different sides of the same coin. Memory integration may protect against interference between the content of related memories, while memory for the source or context of those individual events is lost or diminished. This research examines how memory integration affects interference between overlapping memories and the source memory of those individual memories.
