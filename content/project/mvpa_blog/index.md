For my final project in *Applied Machine Learning for Educational Data Science*, I worked with a team to develop a predictive model for student performance on statewide exams of reading and math. Data was pulled from outside sources (e.g., the *National Center for Educational Statistics*) and compiled to train and tune our predictive model. Information regarding the Kaggle competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/edld-654-fall-2020/overview/description). Among the various supervised learning techniques we learned using `tidymodels`, our team decided to try 1) linear modeling, 2) random forest model, and 3) boosted tree models. Our team, the *Tensor Flo Ridas*, took second place! You can find our code and a walkthrough of our models [here](https://camkay.github.io/edld654_blog/index.html).
