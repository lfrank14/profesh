There is substantial variability in the clinical expression of neuropathology following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These inconsistencies may be explained, in part, by cognitive reserve. The cognitive reserve theory posits that intelligence and intellectual enrichment can protect against neuropathology. Though cognitive reserve has been commonly studied in aging and neurological disease like Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis, little is known how it protects individuals following TBI. This project examined how cognitive reserve moderates the relationship between neuropathology and cognitive outcomes after TBI.
