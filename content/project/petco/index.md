The hippocampus contributes to both remembering specific events and generalization across events. Recent work suggests that information may be represented along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus at varied levels of specificity: detailed representations in the posterior hippocampus and generalized representations in the anterior hippocampus. This project explores 1) how anterior and posterior hippocampus form distinct connections with cortical memory regions consistent with their hypothesized role in memory generalization and specificity, and 2) how individual differences in these connections relate to individual memory specificity and generalization abilities.
