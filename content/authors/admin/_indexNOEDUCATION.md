I'm a quantitative researcher with a passion for data analysis and storytelling. I have 8 years of experience in scientific research, with highly developed skills in computer programming, data analysis, project management, and communicating findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. Having recently completed my Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience and a specialization in educational data science, I am eager to apply my expertise in an industry setting. This website contains a portfolio of projects, highlighting my proficiency in statistical analysis, data engineering, visualization, and storytelling, and productivity with both independent and collaborative projects.
