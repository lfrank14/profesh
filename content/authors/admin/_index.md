I'm a PhD student studying cognitive neuroscience and data science at the University of Oregon. I work in Dr. Dasa Zeithamova's [Brain & Memory Lab](https://cognem.uoregon.edu/) studying how memories are used to guide novel decisions and generate new knowledge. My research employs behavioral and fMRI techniques to understand memory-guided decision making. Through my research, I discovered a passion for data analysis and storytelling. Following graduation, I will be seeking data science position where I can apply that passion to solving real-world problems.
