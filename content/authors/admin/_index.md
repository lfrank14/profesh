I'm a quantitative researcher with 8+ years of experience. I have passion for data analysis and storytelling, with highly developed skills in computer programming, statistical analysis, project management, and communicating findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. Having recently completed my Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience and a specialization in educational data science, I am eager to launch into a new career in data science. This website contains a portfolio of projects, highlighting my proficiency in data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning, visualization, and storytelling.
