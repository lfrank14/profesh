I'm a recent PhD graduate with 8+ years of experience in project management, experimentation, statistical analysis, and data storytelling. Equipped with a passion for data and a hunger to learn (and some other relevant skills), I'm eager to tackle data problems with real-world impact. This website contains a portfolio of projects highlighting my proficiency in experimental design, data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and storytelling. My projects are organized into two categories to 1) highlight relevant data science projects, and 2) provide context of my research background in the domain of human learning and memory. Links to blog posts, dashboards, and Github repos are provided!
