abstract: 'The hippocampus contributes to both remembering specific events and generalization
  across events. Recent work suggests that information may be represented along the
  longitudinal axis of the hippocampus at varied levels of specificity: detailed representations
  in the posterior hippocampus and generalized representations in the anterior hippocampus.
  Similar distinctions are thought to exist within neocortex, with lateral prefrontal
  and lateral parietal regions supporting memory specificity and ventromedial prefrontal
  and lateral temporal cortices supporting generalized memory. Here, we tested whether
  functional connectivity of anterior and posterior hippocampus with cortical memory
  regions is consistent with these proposed dissociations. We predicted greater connectivity
  of anterior hippocampus with putative generalization regions and posterior hippocampus
  with putative memory specificity regions. Furthermore, we tested whether differences
  in connectivity are stable under varying levels of task engagement. Participants
  learned to categorize a set of stimuli outside the scanner, followed by an fMRI
  session that included a rest scan, passive viewing runs, and category generalization
  task runs. Analyses revealed stronger connectivity of ventromedial pFC to anterior
  hippocampus and of angular gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus to posterior hippocampus.
  These differences remained relatively stable across the three phases (rest, passive
  viewing, category generalization). Whole-brain analyses further revealed widespread
  cortical connectivity with both anterior and posterior hippocampus, with relatively
  little overlap. These results contribute to our understanding of functional organization
  along the long axis of the hippocampus and suggest that distinct hippocampal-cortical
  connections are one mechanism by which the hippocampus represents both individual
  experiences and generalized knowledge.'
