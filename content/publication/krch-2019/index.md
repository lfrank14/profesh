abstract: 'Objective: To evaluate whether cognitive reserve (CR) moderates the relationship
  between neuropathology and cognitive outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI).
  Setting: Outpatient research organization. Participants: Patients with complicated
  mild (n = 8), moderate (n = 9), and severe (n = 44) TBI. Design: Prospective, cross-sectional
  study. Main Measures: Cognitive reserve was estimated using a test of word reading
  (Wechsler Test of Adult Reading). Diffusion tensor imaging (functional anisotropy)
  was used to quantify neuropathology. Neuropsychological test scores were submitted
  to principal components analyses to create cognitive composites for memory, attention,
  executive function, and processing speed domains. Results: At lower levels of neuropathology,
  people with higher CR exhibited better memory than those with lower CR. This benefit
  diminished as neuropathology increased and disappeared at the highest levels of
  neuropathology. Cognitive reserve ceased exerting a protective effect at premorbid
  intelligence levels below average. Conclusion: Cognitive reserve may differentially
  protect some cognitive domains against neuropathology relative to others. A clinical
  cutoff below which CR is no longer protective, together with a possible neuropathology
  ceiling effect, may be instructive for prognostication and clinical decision-making
  in cognitive rehabilitation.'
