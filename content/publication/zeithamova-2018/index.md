abstract: Motivation enhances memory by increasing hippocampal engagement during encoding.
  However, whether such increased hippocampal activation reflects encoding of the
  value of highly rewarding events per se is less understood. Here, we tested in humans
  whether hippocampus represents abstract reward value, independent of perceptual
  content, using a monetary incentive encoding task with a novel manipulation. During
  functional MRI scanning, men and women studied object pairs, each preceded by a
  monetary reward cue indicating the amount of money they would receive if they successfully
  remembered the object pair at test. Reward cues varied on both the level of reward
  (penny, dime, and dollar) and visual form (picture or word) across trials to dissociate
  hippocampal responses to reward value from those reflecting the perceptual properties
  of the cues. Behaviorally, participants remembered pairs associated with the high
  reward (dollar) more often than pairs associated with lower rewards. Neural pattern
  similarity analysis revealed that hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activation
  patterns discriminated between cues of different value irrespective of their visual
  form, and that hippocampal discrimination of value was most pronounced in participants
  who showed the greatest behavioral sensitivity to reward. Strikingly, hippocampal
  patterns were most distinct for reward cues that differed in value but had similar
  visual appearance, consistent with theoretical proposals of hippocampal pattern
  differentiation of competing representations. Our data illustrate how contextual
  representations within the hippocampus go beyond space and time to include information
  about the motivational salience of events, with hippocampal reward coding tracking
  the motivational impact on later memory. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Motivation, such
  as the promise of future rewards, enhances hippocampal engagement during encoding
  and promotes successful retention of events associated with valuable rewards. However,
  whether the hippocampus explicitly encodes reward value, dissociable from sensory
  information, is unclear. Here, we show that the hippocampus forms abstract representation
  of valuable rewards, encoding conceptual rather than perceptual information about
  the motivational context of individual events. Reward representation within hippocampus
  is associated with preferential retention of high-value events in memory. Furthermore,
  we show that hippocampal pattern differentiation serves to emphasize differences
  between visually similar events with distinct motivational salience. Collectively,
  these findings indicate that hippocampal contextual representations allow individuals
  to distinguish the motivational value of events, leading to prioritized encoding
  of significant memories.
