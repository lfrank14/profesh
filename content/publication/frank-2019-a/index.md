abstract: External motivation, such as a promise of future monetary reward for remembering
  an event, can affect which events are remembered. Reward-based memory modulation
  is thought to result from encoding and post-encoding interactions between dopaminergic
  midbrain, signaling reward, and hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, supporting
  episodic memory. We asked whether hippocampal and parahippocampal interactions with
  other reward-related regions are related to reward modulation of memory and whether
  such relationships are stable over time. Individuals' memory sensitivity to reward
  was measured using a monetary incentive encoding task in which a cue indicated potential
  monetary reward (penny, dime, or dollar) for remembering an upcoming object pair.
  Functional connectivity between memory and reward regions was measured before, during,
  and following the task. Reward-related regions of interest were generated using
  a meta-analysis of existing studies on reward and included ventral striatum, medial
  and orbital prefrontal cortices and anterior cingulate cortex, in addition to midbrain.
  The results showed that connectivity between memory and reward regions tracked individual
  differences in reward modulation of memory, irrespective of when connectivity was
  measured. Connectivity patterns of anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, and
  ventral striatum covaried together and tracked behavior most strongly. These findings
  implicate a broader set of reward regions in reward modulation of memory than considered
  previously and provide new evidence that stable connectivity patterns between memory
  and reward centers relate to individual differences in how reward impacts memory.
